            <div id="info"><h4 id="mainheading">ABOUT</h4><p id="txt">Hamza is a guy likes to play video games and spend most of his time with his pets and family. He also likes to travel a lot.
He doesn’t have many friends but the couple of friends he has are really special to him.  He likes to study in groups rather than alone.

Hamza is currently studying in England, away from his home country.  He likes to live independently. He goes to his country every year to meet his family and spend time with them.
He really misses his mom’s handmade food. He is really close to his family and friends.
One thing Hamza doesn’t like is roller coasters and dangerous rides. He is really scared of rides.
Video games, photography and travelling. that sums him up.
