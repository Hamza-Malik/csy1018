Thankfully he also loves figuring out how put them back together and get them working again. He naturally blames it on all that Lego as a child, but it seemingly made him a great programmer too.
A problem solver and inquisitive by nature he may be, but he also spontaneously combusts into laughter at the most random of things - it really isn't unusual to find Joel giggling away, curiously infectious to many others around him.
He can usually found buried deep in code wailing out the hits of the 80s thinking nobody else can hear him, or touring around the world for the latest fix of adrenaline on a terrifying new rollercoaster.
Sometimes though he loves nothing better than simply soaking up a beautiful sunset at a picturesque natural location with his significant otherâ€¦ a laptop of course!
Code, coasters, cats, cookies and Pepsi (not coffee!)... that sums him up.
But seriously, who are you?

I'm a progammer or coder who loves PHP, Javascript and a few other languages too. I'm currently a full time developer at DRP after graduating from the University of Worcester with a 1st class honours in Computing.
You can get a little more detail about me on Twitter, LinkedIn or GitHub. You can also check out some of the work I've done previously too. And don't forget to drop me a message quick message below, or get in touch.</p></div>
